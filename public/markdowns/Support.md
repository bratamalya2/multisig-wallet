## About support

TimeAlly DApp is a open-source smart contract user interface for TimeAlly Smart Contracts on Era Swap Network. Please note that support requests for recovery of any lost funds is not entertained (because it cannot be entertained due to the immutable nature of blockchain). The development is overseen by open-source contributors on GitHub incentivized by Era Swap Community. GitHub is the world's leading software development platform which is popular for hosting open-source projects and hence it's used for managing Era Swap's open-source projects.
